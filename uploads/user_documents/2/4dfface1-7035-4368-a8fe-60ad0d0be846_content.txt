Azure
 
Resource
 
Creation
 
Guide
 
for
 
the
 
AI
 
Mega
 
Toolkit
 
This
 
guide
 
provides
 
step-by-step
 
instructions
 
for
 
creating
 
the
 
necessary
 
Azure
 
Cognitive
 
Services
 
resources
 
in
 
the
 
Azure
 
portal.
 
General
 
Steps
 
for
 
Creating
 
Resources
 
in
 
Azure
 
Portal:
 
1.
 
Go
 
to
 
the
 
Azure
 
portal
 
and
 
sign
 
in.
 
2.
 
In
 
the
 
top
 
search
 
bar,
 
type
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
service
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
create.
 
3.
 
Select
 
the
 
service
 
from
 
the
 
search
 
results
 
under
 
the
 
"Services"
 
or
 
"Marketplace"
 
category.
 
4.
 
Click
 
the
 
"Create"
 
button
 
(it
 
might
 
be
 
under
 
a
 
specific
 
plan
 
or
 
offering
 
of
 
the
 
service).
 
5.
 
Fill
 
in
 
the
 
required
 
details
 
on
 
the
 
creation
 
blade.
 
Common
 
fields
 
include:
 
○
 
Subscription
:
 
Choose
 
your
 
Azure
 
subscription.
 
○
 
Resource
 
group
:
 
You
 
can
 
select
 
an
 
existing
 
resource
 
group
 
or
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
one
 
(e.g.,
 
AIServicesResourceGroup).
 
A
 
resource
 
group
 
is
 
a
 
container
 
that
 
holds
 
related
 
resources
 
for
 
an
 
Azure
 
solution.
 
○
 
Region
 
(Location)
:
 
Select
 
a
 
region
 
where
 
the
 
service
 
will
 
be
 
deployed
 
(e.g.,
 
"East
 
US",
 
"West
 
Europe").
 
Choose
 
a
 
region
 
geographically
 
close
 
to
 
your
 
users
 
or
 
where
 
your
 
other
 
application
 
components
 
might
 
be
 
hosted.
 
○
 
Name
:
 
Give
 
your
 
resource
 
a
 
unique
 
name
 
(e.g.,
 
MyMegaToolkitTranslator,
 
MyMegaToolkitLanguage).
 
○
 
Pricing
 
tier
:
 
Select
 
a
 
pricing
 
tier.
 
Most
 
Cognitive
 
Services
 
offer
 
a
 
Free
 
tier
 
(often
 
named
 
F0
 
or
 
similar)
 
which
 
is
 
suitable
 
for
 
development
 
and
 
testing
 
with
 
limited
 
capacity.
 
For
 
production,
 
you'd
 
select
 
a
 
Standard
 
tier
 
(e.g.,
 
S0,
 
S1).
 
6.
 
Review
 
the
 
settings
 
and
 
click
 
"Review
 
+
 
create",
 
then
 
"Create".
 
7.
 
Wait
 
for
 
the
 
deployment
 
to
 
complete.
 
8.
 
Once
 
deployed,
 
click
 
"Go
 
to
 
resource".
 
9.
 
In
 
the
 
resource's
 
menu
 
(usually
 
on
 
the
 
left),
 
find
 
the
 
"Keys
 
and
 
Endpoint"
 
section
 
(the
 
exact
 
naming
 
might
 
vary
 
slightly,
 
e.g.,
 
"Resource
 
Management"
 
->
 
"Keys
 
and
 
Endpoint").
 
This
 
is
 
where
 
you'll
 
find
 
the
 
credentials
 
your
 
application
 
needs.

typically
 
just
 
needs
 
the
 
base

for
 
the
 
service.
 
○
